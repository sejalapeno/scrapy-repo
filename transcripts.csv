But how could they land,a transmitter here?,I don't think they did. I think,they're using one of ours as a booster.,Phew.,If we could wreck it, we could put them,out of commission... at least round here.,Without the beam they'd just be,dead hunks of machinery.,That's right, if the, uh, theory's correct.,And how do we find the transmitter?,With this and a piece of copper wire.,Well, you better pick up that walkie-talkie,so we can keep in touch with Peggy.,Sure.,When you reach the lowest volume...,the transmitter should be in a direct line,with the plane of the antenna.,You take a reading and enter it on the map.,Then you drive a ways,and take another reading.,Then a third about here.,Where the three lines intersect should be,our transmitter. See how it's done?,Yes, it's the same way they used,to track down amateur wireless sets...,- that were causing interference, isn't it?,- That's right.,- Jeff.,- Here. Let me have it.,- Jeff.,- We've just taken the first reading.,Everything all right there? Over.,It's quiet as a tomb here.

Peggy!,- The robots.,- What?,Peggy!,Let it go.,Taggart!,- Oh, Jeff!,- Peggy. Are you all right?,- Yes.,- I don't understand how you stopped them.,We blew up the transmission tower. Without,the signal they're just so much machinery.,Do you think it's safe now?,- Maybe there are other towers.,- I don't know. Maybe there are.,But the main thing is we know how,to stop them now, wherever they are.,Unless they try to use gas again.,There's always been that chance,,and there always will be.,Let's see the baby.

We're singing songs.,- Cool guys!,- Who left you people alone tonight?,- That's what I wanna know.,My parents thought of us,as a delusional experiment,where we didn't know,how to play our instruments.,We came to New,York to try to prove,we were a real band,,The Moldy Peaches.,Tonight, we're going,to a birthday party,for the Queen,of fucking France.,We just wanted to find,a place to play music.,Hi!,Hi.,- Hi. Hi.,- Hi.,The Lower East side,was more or less barren,,delis and boarded up places.,Most places we,found were sort of,a more bougie club scene.,We'd walk into these rooms,and be like, ""Oh, oops."",It felt like,all of that wild,,weird eclecticness had,drained out of the city.,I remember thinking maybe,New York isn't the kind,of city anymore,that produces iconic bands.,Even MTV was filled,with super dry pop-rock.,And the winner for best rock is,The Offspring!,Blink 182.-,Limp Bizkit, Rollin.,Friday, 2:12 p.m.,-

come down,to play these quiet,acoustic guitar songs.,I was grateful,playing at any venue,in New York City,,but it just wasn't,exciting me.,I was skulking around,the music scene,trying to sniff out some blood.,The last big wave,of New York bands,was a long time passed.,I wanted something,explosive to happen,without understanding,what that was.,One day, me and Kimya were,at our friend's party.,This drunk guy called Julian,comes over...,and he's in the bathroom doing,drugs with this young lady,,he breaks the shower.,Somebody said he,was a singer in a

Hey, Julian.,- Oh, man.,I ran into Julian,on the street,seven years after I'd met him,in boarding school.,Then I met everyone.,I just felt it.,The closeness.,We were like brothers.,They were so tight and together,,and are such good friends.,It just feels like,the five of them,make up one person.,Just one solid person on stage.,By now, most people,have heard of Y2K,,the anagram shorthand,for the year 2000,computer problem.,Americans have proven,they can handle,even the most devastating,natural disaster.,But can we survive a man-made,technological meltdown?,It's now time to,begin stockpiling,essential survival items.,Military meals,,gas masks to knives.,When your kids are standing,there cold and hungry,,and they come up,to you and say,""Mommy,,Daddy, why didn't you get

Bar,where he hung out.,I felt this very visceral,reaction towards him.,I needed to be connected,to this person.,She talked,like a valley girl,but said that,she was from Jersey.,Every other word was ""dude"".,I'd never met,anybody like that.,When you're young,and in New York,and you find,like-minded people,,you just end up doing,things together every night.,Karen played me songs,that she had written.,I was just completely,blown away.,I may be dead, honey,But I was left with my eyes,And underneath, sugar,Well, I've been sunk,by your lies...,One night, Karen said,,-

Chuecatown (2007) - full transcript,"In BOYSTOWN (Chuecatown), Victor (Pablo Puyol of 20 Centimeters) is a real estate agent in the quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Chueca in Madrid. But he hides a terrible secret; his apartments become available for sale when he murders the elderly women owners and disguises them as suicides. Then Victor quickly refurbishes the apartments to upwardly-mobile gay couples because his ultimate goal is to transform the neighborhood into a hip gayborhood like the Castro in San Francisco and Chelsea in New York. The latest victim s apartment is next door to gay couple Ray (Carlos Fuentes of Kilometer Zero) and Leo (Pepón Nieto of Bulgarian Lovers) who eventually inherit the apartment and offer it as a gift to Ray s mother Antonia (Concha Velasco of Kilometer Zero). But Victor only wants high income gays to move in and he begins a plot to remove Antonia from the premises. Toss in the eccentric Inspector Mila (Rosa Maria Sardà of All About My Mother) and her charmingly clueless son Luis, assigned to investigate the murders, and soon the neighborhood of Chueca is brimming with comic mishaps, sexy seductions and more murders!","A modern, tolerant,,fun neighborhood,has become a space for the young,and a target for main trademarks,selling sophistication.,We've renovated 200 flats,and over 100 stores,,thanks to which we are making it,the ideal neighborhood,of our dreams.,But there's still much to do.,lf good taste is of,vital importance to you,,if you want ideal beauty,surrounding you,,if you need a new life:,Come visit us!,
